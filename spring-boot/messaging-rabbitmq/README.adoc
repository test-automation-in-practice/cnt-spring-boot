= Spring Boot: Messaging with RabbitMq

This module implements asynchronous communication through messaging via a RabbitMQ broker, both on the sending and the
receiving end, using Spring's AMQP integration:

- `AmqpTemplate` to send messages
- `@RabbitListener` to read messages
- Error handling and dead-letter topics
- Testing with a RabbitMQ instance running in a dockerized TestContainer
