= Spring Boot: Messaging with Kafka

This module implements asynchronous communication through messaging via a Kafka broker, both on the sending and the
receiving end, using Spring's Kafka integration:

- `KafkaTemplate` to send messages
- `@KafkaListener` to receive messages
- Error handling and dead-letter topics
- Testing with a Kafka instance running in a dockerized _TestContainer_
