= Spring Boot: GraphQL

This module demonstrates:

- How to test _GraphQL_ `Controller` using `@GraphQlTest` and `GraphQlTester`.
- How to write high level smoke tests for _GraphQL_ APIs

For a way more complex example of how to define and test a GraphQL API in Spring Boot, take a look at the link:https://github.com/test-automation-in-practice/showcase-skill-manager[SkillManager] showcase.
Included here are, among other things:

* more complex queries and mutations than this example provides
* three domains in separate modules each adding parts of the overall GraphQL schema
* custom Scalar type conversion
