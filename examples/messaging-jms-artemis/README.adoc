= Spring Boot: Messaging with Artemis (JMS)

This module implements asynchronous communication through messaging using JMS via an ActiveMQ (Artemis) broker, both on the sending and the receiving end, using Spring's JMS integration:

- `JmsTemplate` to send messages
- `@JmsListener` to receive messages
- Error handling and dead-letter queues
- Testing with a containerized broker
