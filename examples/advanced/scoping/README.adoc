= Spring Boot: Scoping is Important

This showcase demonstrates how only writing End-to-End Tests for the whole application will either leave relevant code uncovered or will lead to messy test classes with all kinds of compensation code for provoking testable behaviour.

In this scenario there is one big End-to-End Test for everything that should be testet as well as alternative lower-level tests for the same logical tests.
You can compare these tests and how they differ in maintainability, runtime and general structure.

Event though this is just a very small example, it should be enough to demonstrate that not everything that should be testet can be covered by the highest level of tests.
At least not without polluting those tests with knowledge / dependencies they should not have.
