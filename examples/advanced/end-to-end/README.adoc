= Spring Boot: End-to-End Tests are Important

This showcase demonstrates how End-to-End Tests are needed to secure your codebase from specific risks, that cannot really be mitigated on any other level.

In this scenario all functional parts of the application are very efficiently tested using appropriate scopes and abstraction.
But a specific refactoring done to make a side effect within the `BookCollection` component asynchronous, will break the application without any tests detecting the issue.
Except for the End-to-End `ApplicationTests`.

There are of course ways to implement that asynchronous behaviour "correctly" in a way that will not break the application.
But the point is to demonstrate that a very trivial change in a small application can have unintended consequences because not every consequence was known / considered.

Imagine what could happen in a "real" application with a much larger codebase and complexity!
